# The-Scavenger

This is a work in progress side project that Angel and I are working on in our free time to expand our knowledge on game design, game programming, and Unity3d it self.

This game is planned to be a 3rd Person Action RPG set in a world destroyed by a robot war, the player is a scavenger that finds scrap to either build, upgrade, or sell to become stronger all while either avoiding or fighting enemies.
